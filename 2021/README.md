 # AoC 2021

My AoC solutions, this year done in Nim! Any files named `day{number}p` are versions rewritten to be nice afterwards.

The library I'm using for all my fancy automated input can be found [here](https://github.com/MichalMarsalek/Advent-of-code/tree/master/2021/Nim)! I've made a few small tweaks for my own conveince.
